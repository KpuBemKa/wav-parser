 What is the best kind of cheese to use to catch a bear? Someone knows over here. Obviously the answer is Camembert. Camembert? Camembert? Okay. Thank you. I have a head full of cheese puns, but I was told I have to keep it brief. What did the piece of cheese say when it looked into the mirror? No. It said, halloumi. Hello, me. What can I say, guys? I love a good pun.
